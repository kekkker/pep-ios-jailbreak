# pEp for jailbroken iOS 16

This repository builds the GPLv3 `pEpForiOS` client from the official pEp
Codeberg sources. It produces an arm64 IPA fakesigned with the app-group
entitlement required by pEp, ready for installation with TrollStore.

The upstream application is currently unavailable from the App Store. Its
public build also references a private configuration-only framework. This
repository supplies a clean-room replacement containing public bundle and app
group identifiers, and deliberately leaves commercial OAuth credentials empty.

The build is pinned through upstream's own `.submodules.json` manifests. No
mail credentials, signing certificates, Apple accounts, or device secrets are
stored here.

## Build

Run the `Build TrollStore IPA` GitHub Actions workflow. Successful builds upload
`pEp-iOS16-trollstore.ipa` as an artifact.

## License

The build glue in this repository is GPL-3.0-or-later. Upstream components keep
their respective licenses.
